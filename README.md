# hello-world
Looking to start some outreach/marketing with potential entrepreneurs.

Hi. My name is Dustin. I am in my mid 30s and have become interested in 
web design and marketing, as well as some game development
on the side. Looking forward to meeting new and exciting partners who 
share common interests. You can find me at:

out.
